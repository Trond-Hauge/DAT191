# Website for HEQED - Health Equality for a Sustainable Society through Education

This is a bachelor project at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) in Computer Science. As per 22nd of February, it's still very much work in progress.

The website uses the framework Next.js, together with PostgreSQL as database. The authentication is build on JWT, stored in a cookie to let the user browse without frequently having to logging in. User may, of course, log out if wanted.

Further work beyond the website is making a virtual meeting application, meant to be implemented on the Streaming page, which is hinted to in the image under "Home Page" below. The virtual application will be made with Unreal Engine. If Pixel Streaming is implemented, it will be streamed from a cloud computer, and may allow photo realistic, virtually no matter what device the user is on.
